### Third part Libraries and packages

- react-navigation

this package has been used to manage the App navigation, because it is so simple to implement and build navigations stack, for me is simpler than `react-native-navigation`

- react-native-screens

this is a pair dependencie for `react-navigation` thies help us to use all navigation stack as a native module

- react-native-ui-lib

it offers simple solutions to commons components like buttons badges and other, in this project it was used to build a list of item with swipeable gesture, for me is simpler than build the swippeable component only with `react-native-gesture-handler` and this last dependencie is used by `react-native-ui-lib` the othe dependenciens no describe here are dependencies by `react-native-ui-lib`

-@react-native-async-storage/async-storage

this dependencies is used to handle data persist, is simpler and the recomend solution by react native community
